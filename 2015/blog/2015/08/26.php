Change of plan.
I'm a deim spontanious person.
It's no LeonidWorld or any of that kind of mess.
It's LeonidFineArt.
Dot.
Doneskies.
No more wobling.

However.... XD
You do never know, it's me, ain't it. But, for this time it will be Fine Art themed. I want those limitations, I want to stimulate myself to do art, not just random stuff, no, art. And I want to be known as a painter, not as an internet-key-smashing-thingy-ma-guy.

It is extremely important for my soul to do artist job, the blog and online things would be there to back it up. 
Buddha told his students:<i> care that the path to salvation does not become your end destination.</i> 
And that what was about to happen with me. The "funny guy", who makes movie lively and gives people smiles almoost became the main character, which would turn the film from a interesting thoughtfull picture into a dull soap opera.

But, luckily enough that didn't happen and I noticed the problem quickly.

There still will be off topic posts here and there, but I want the main hero to be my art. A note fer ye is that this whole blog idea came when I realised that I will not be willing to sell ma pictures to people who won't value them, there for the pricing went up for me sooo high, that I realised that it ain't gonna be "to go" income, so I went looking 'roud the art thing for where you can make money, and came up with this blog idea and also some othrs, like street painting, and giving lessons, but I'm stll a student meself and street painting wont really attract people in my hometown, I won't think (but may be I shall try...).
I will write about pricing a cmprehencive guide tomorrow or at least soon, so keep an eye out for that, but for today its a fare well, I going to bed.

Thanks for reading,
Leonid
