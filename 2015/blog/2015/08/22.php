So here I go, sailing into the unknown world, without my native language, any kind of insuarance policy/fallback plan or even any idea of the waters I am about to get the bout of my life deep into.
I've descided to start blogging.

Yesterday after breakfest I had this sudden crack in my backbone, like a spiral, heavily suppresed, titghtly packed, just randomly zigzagged in my soul. I felt the drive, the power within... People who know me know that I do travel a lot with a stick, that kind of stick that is always found laying 'round. And I regulary break the stick leaning on it when I used it for a while with the felling of "you served me well, but all those thoughts I carry are way to heavy even for you...".

So, yeah, thats tipical me. I do like feeling myself part of a story, that really does bighten up your life. 

And back to our salt mines, yesterday at 'round 8:00 am, as I walked out of the local canteen I felt like I got smashed with a heavingly mallet of goodness, wich is totaly a thing, take my word on it, at that moment I felt like I no longer need da dem walking stick. All the thoughts that I was carrying were still there, but they never felt lighter! It was just a midblowing experience! Well, slow down there, me, fella, I would bet it probably went away by the time you were munching on luch the same day, nah? Nah! It's still here! It's been 2 days and I still got it. I fell like I can move the mountains, split the seas. I've been planning for the future for these two days straight and that's where this idea of blogging came from. ...

Here I went to bed cause my dearest PC went hell's blazes out of power. And here I'm back. It's morning â€” 7:21, 23rd August. To finish what I was talking about, I'm gona start blogging, and I have great plans for it, wast infrastucrute in mind.
Hope you find this interesting and may be inspiring for greatness.
Thanks!
