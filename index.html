<pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;">
Why would people care what we have to say?
This question goes all the way back to mount Sinai.
A time when everyone in the world stopped to care.
With an exception of one people.
They were given the Torah, and, as we all know, if they were to reject, the whole world would be over.
Is there a need for G-d?
How to disprove idolatry?
