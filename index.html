• Why would people care what we have to say?

This question goes all the way back to mount Sinai.
A time when everyone in the world ceased to care.
With the exception of one people.
They were given the Torah, and, as I understand, if they were to reject, the whole world would be over.
G-d chose not to reveal himself to the entire world, but only to the jewish nation.


<i>Perhaps these questions might have something:</i>

• Is there a need for G-d?

¯\(°_o)/¯

• How to disprove idolatry?

Abraham? ¯\(°_o)/¯


The society has seemingly no need for G-d, since all that they might ever need comes from the world.
It used to be through idolatry, which as I understand was actually a thing, that worked before it was removed as requested by the sages.
People would do it and get what they wanted. And they would derive their laws from idols.
Nowadays, in a material world, people look for the laws in the nature still.
They base it on the desire for pleasure and the fleeing of pain.
However the basis are the same, that the world has in it some laws that are just there.
It is said that the one who follows the 7 laws out of his own wisdom is indeed a wiseman of the nations.
Therefore it is obvious that merely following the 7 laws is something that is possible to achieve through just the world, regardless of G-d.
It is also said that one who follows these laws would get his reward in this world and the world of souls (which I don't get, since I have no idea what a soul is, and how can we see that we have one), but not the world to come.
Nobody even knows what a "world to come" is (me included), and most would not care for it, something like: "Who is rich? One who is satisfied with his lot.". They are satisfied with their lives, and would not go out of their way to study hard to understand what is that "world to come".

I study not for anything I would gain, moreover it is hard for me to put myself to study and I do it against what I would want, but out of understanding that what you say has practical applications on one's life (mine included), and if you are right, the implications must be taken into account, akin to the knowledge that we provide to our kids that animals feel pain too, so that they might take this into account when handling the said animals. In the end they have a choice to be carefull with bugs and cats and what have you, but unless they know that these can suffer they can not chose care for the creatures' lives.one's life
