• Why would people care what we have to say?

This question goes all the way back to mount Sinai.
A time when everyone in the world ceased to care.
With the exception of one people.
They were given the Torah, and, as I understand, if they were to reject, the whole world would be over.
G-d chose not to reveal himself to the entire world, but only to the jewish nation.


<i>Perhaps these questions might have something:</i>

• Is there a need for G-d?

¯\(°_o)/¯

• How to disprove idolatry?

Abraham? ¯\(°_o)/¯


The society has seemingly no need for G-d, since all that they might ever need comes from the world.
It used to be through idolatry, which as I understand was actualy a thing, that worked before it was removed as requested by the sages.
People would do it and get what they wanted. And they would derive their laws from idols.
Nowadays, in a material world, people look for the laws in the nature still.
They base it on the desire for pleasure and the fleeing of pain.
However the basis are the same, that the world has in it some laws that come from itself.
It is said that the one who follows the 7 laws out of his own wisdom is indeed a wiseman of the nations.
Therefore it is obvious that merely folowing the 7 laws is something that is possible to achieve through just the world, regardless of G-d.
It is also said that one who follows these laws would get his reward in this world and the world of souls (wich I don't get, since I have no idea what a soul is, and how can we see thet we have one), but not the world to come.
