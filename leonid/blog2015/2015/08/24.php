Hiaz!
Welcome back!
One more buizy day fer me... But not without progress on the blog ;)

Today I've been looking fo rthe name once again, also trying to figure out whether I would like to run my own, custom coded blogging platform, or simply snag meself dat WordPress and get it cranking. So far I've been gravitating towards WordPress for w'ole bunch 'o reasons.

I. It is ready! I don't have to code the core, which is while being exciting could still be a difficult task for me, note that I am just a second year student at programming and mind that we bever did study web progs, only the computer ones.

II. It has themes!!! This is awesome, I love coding (in case you did not get it from the fact that I study it fer life), I will be able to code myself some dat CSS, get an amazing(hopefully) custom theme.

III. It has plugins! There are thigs that are hard to code for me, like say an email getter. In order for it to be secure you need to know security protocols and enscription, and all of that I never studied anywhere, so I simply have no idea of how to implement them. WordP's plugins sort that issue out.

IV. Something-something saaaamthing... I'm getting increasingly tired, it's 23:19 where I live and that's waaaay to late for me, I'm used to going to bed at 9pm, do you see what Ima talking 'bout?

It's deym latte. But so far I still fell like I can ramble a bit longer.

So today a Minister of international relationships ~somename~ Lavrov came around, really awesome dude, keeping Russia from all confrontations, doing great job at it, I can see that rescently it must have been hard fer 'im, all the politics that's been going on in the world... I do not really keep in touch with the topic but I do hear a lot about it from people 'round me.

I got featured on TV! Tell you what, it feels good to be a star!!! XD

No, relly, that was like the second time I got meself some coverage, first time was when I went to 4th grade at my school and TV men came 'round to film a report 'bout the School Day - first of September. So my face was seen on that footage clearly and I was super happy, and now I got to feel that once more. 

Great to be so popular to get featured on TV))

Soooo, that about does it for today, here are the two extra names I came up with today and I probably aleady posted a screenshot of that video report. So far no post have justified the name - LeonidFineArt, that is the only reason I'm still unsure of it:
it's not only art, it is more of a whole life of mine, that I see as art.
It's that soul that I put into my work that I call art here, but that does not truly justify the FineArt part of it... We'll see)))

Thank you all for reading, and have a nice day!

See ya round!
