Ho-hello people.

I'm a bit sick today, throat hurts like inferno and the head is a but numb. Yet I still decided to go for a blog post, because developing a habbit is very important in things like this, and I saw a great oportunity to practice just that in being sick, yet writing a post, so that whan I'm not sick it'll be easyer than ever to write one.

Today was the last day of my job, two 24-hour cycles and I'll be on my way home. Sweeeeet hoooome, Alabaaaaaama!...
So today I spent most of my free time playing around with code, just trying to get a feel of what it would require to write a usable semi-automadet blogging platform. I'm still probably going to use worpress, but I wanted to test the waters of my web-developing self. Turn out I'm much cooler than I'm used to be, but still pretty deym not pro. But I never studied that anywhere so I'm proud of meself.

I also did some sketching that was hurshly interrupted by job duties, feels so good that the job is over, may be morrow I'll try to go for some'ing more of a propper sketch. I still 'ave some job to be finished and there is Physycs that is my shadow since I failed to close out the studying thingy-ma-job, no idea what's it called in english. Call it half a year 'o studies, yeah, that thing.

There is an idea conserning ma plans that just poped up in my head, I sould have like a "Articless planned" page, where I will post all the things that I wanted to talk 'bout whaen I 'ave free time. I can only remember "Pricing point" and "Buisiness model for online Arts" or some'img  close to that that must currently be on there. There should also be more of a long term, "Golden Box" page with stuff that I find interesting but ether not currently willing to write on the topic, or perhapps not knoledgable enough for discussion on this subject.

Man, I'm getting really tired... The eyes are just slamming like dors from the blowing of the wind. (This is a metaphora, 100% legit!)

So I guess good night, morrow comes - I shall write nore dayly blog, yet for today that's it.
Have a nice daaaa-eeeee-eeey, have a nice day!
Cya 'round.
