Hey!

It's my forth blogpost! Bieeeeeeeg achi'ment, yey?
Well for me - indeed. I am not saying it's unlike me to be able to do something that I planned to do or anithing... Now, I don't know what I'm taliking 'bout, lets get doen to bousiness.

So today was (surprize, surprize!) one more buisy day. That what you got to deal with when you got a job, anyway, today in the morning I thought a lot about the blog and the whole Leonid Romanovsky brand ecosystem, got quite a bit if thoughts going, so I may as well end up listing them here to remember and get some feedback maybe.
Here we go:

[Uno] The name. Today I strayed away from the original idea of LeonidFineArt and got into more of a LeonidWorld or RomanovskyWorld train of thought. This is still debatable, but I am cosidering my target audience to be wider than "FineArt" can cover. I want to market not only what I am as an artist, but rather what I am, what I got in me, my personality and all I've got, and tell you, I've got a lot in me, I did mention that in my firts post.

[Due] I would like to have an easy to use recording device. Podcasts is an industry all by intelf and I do get a lot of ideas and discussions with meself during the day that I just don't have the mood to try to force or recreate. What I tought is an iPhone would probably do the trick, but I do need a professional, or at leat a mid end consumer grade mic, since I plan to edit that fotage and get myself a podcast (podcats)))) going. The idea here is to chop-chop the rambling into a discussion, which, all things considered could be helishly difficult, but... Ain't no nothing 'e stopin' me!

[Tre] My video should have an amazing custom border, since in it the sound is going to be what I'm after (it's vlogs I'm talking about). Some kind of vintage, StarCrafty looks would do the trick, may be I'm gonna go exactly for that theme and get a Protoss, Terran and zerg versions of it and randomly alter them... But that kind of decision is made on the fly, so I'm just teasing meself, dreamin' kinda thing. There should also be cool transition animations between the facecam main and some pic main, for both the fulscreen high importance frames and bordered frames. This is more pf a long shot for me, but It's nice to dream big.

These are the big plans of today, there are also two big aticle topics coming up:

Number one - Love. A dialog.
I got into talking to a girl concerning love, family and devorce and got to express what I know. She did enjoy what I told her and that made thinking of posting it on my blog, but it's a little bit on a longish side.

Numba two - documentary.
Photo, and more speificly Photoshop series. I descided not to blow the idea right away since the realisation may really stretch in time...

I am getting tired, just like my brother sings:

...
Now I'l lying on my bed, stars are shining, it's a dark night...
There is only one though on my mind: oh god, I'm so tired.

Ma eyes are closing and my thoughts are tripping over each other.
So thank you all for reading, and take it easy as Vechs says.

Bye!..
