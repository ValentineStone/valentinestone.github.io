Soo... Today was a hustle, if that is the right word for insane workload that has to be done in a giffy. And not only the actual job was hard. Today I had the task ahead of me to pick the name for my blog. THIS WAS (and still is) INSANE. So far I've stopped on the name LeonidFineArt, but it was soooooo dem hard. 

Lemme explain meself.

The task of picking your online name is vary important. That is not only your hyper-child's name, that is you brand, you marketing face. Lets look though what I had to consider:

1). I needed sothing simple and catchy. Names like The123BESTblogofuserxXxdlrmbcodexXx.com just won't work, See, no one will remember that name except yourself (even if). The name shold be melodical and easily spelable: excoder, xcoder or ecscoder or even ekscoder - two last ones would be a total nightmare to get people to type properly.

2). Something I personaly wanted for my name is for it to have my real name in it. That's why I started my table with LeonidRomanovsky. Having your name in your name (makes sense!) as a great way to market, not only it gives the name a stamp of true identity, it is also easily memorable: our brain gets used to remembeing names and nicknames, so when you got your real name in your online name the brain remeber the name part as usual and the not-name part is treated as nickname which also makes it much more memorable. It's a win-win, both ways, uphill! But wait, ther is more...

~Soo, well, why didn't I end up stopping at LeonidRomanovsky? Tell you the truth - if all the sevces were avaluable at that time, I would have probably fell for it. But fate took another course, and I noticed something extra in namepicking that I consider inportant:

3). Your target market. This says a lot. LeonidFineClothes, LeondJunkArt, LeonidNiceCars, LeonidSomeThings and so on and so forth, you see the point. Pick a market and go for it.

And well... Here is a breakline! STOP! This is starting ti get at me, all this talk... Nah, you all know how it is, pick with your heart, don't settle till you are guns blazing 'bout your name! Put all you've got in it. That's what I did. There are some more advices I can give though, 2 to be precise:

FIRST - get youself a paper, or a computer doc to rigth down things, so you can revisit them, and not think about the same name ten times during the day considering it to be a spanking new, fresh idea.

SECOND - check the name on socials where you plan to be presented, and even on ones you don't: may be days come and you would be happy about that, like I have no idea of what reddit is, but, in the right time I would thank meself for getting the unifiend reddit name. Consider this having twitter as BobbyGunzBlazing, facebook as BobmanRilesSniping and youtube as BobsterTurretsGoingHam. That confuses people of which is which and why they are all kinda different yet all the same. Which one should they use as main for you? So remember the OCD rule: ALL UNIFIED 'N PERFECT.

And that about wraps it up for today, ma firs' lon' blog (ahhh, so proud of meslf). The STOP line in the middle though... That's kind of me and I DO love it. If you like it too, lemme know in the comments, share, subscribe 'n all dat jazz.
Cya, bye!
